## Project Description

This project involves analyzing employee data to predict turnover at Salifort Motors. By building predictive models and identifying key turnover factors, the project provides actionable insights for the HR department to help retain valuable employees and reduce costs associated with high turnover.

## Data

The dataset includes various employee attributes such as:
- **Age**
- **Job role**
- **Department**
- **Years at company**
- **Salary level**
- **Satisfaction level**
- **Last performance rating**
- **Overtime hours**

This dataset provides comprehensive information on employee demographics, work attributes, and performance metrics, which are used to predict turnover.

## Data Analysis and Modeling Steps

The analysis and model-building process involves the following steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Encode categorical variables and standardize numerical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize turnover rates across various employee attributes (e.g., department, job role).
- Analyze the distribution of satisfaction levels, performance ratings, and overtime hours among employees.
- Identify patterns and trends related to turnover.

### 3. Feature Engineering and Selection

- Identify key features that contribute to turnover prediction.
- Use feature selection techniques to select the most predictive features.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

- Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Select the best model based on evaluation metrics and tune its hyperparameters.

### 5. Data Visualization

- Create visualizations such as bar charts, feature importance plots, and confusion matrices to illustrate findings and model performance.

## Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we will derive actionable insights and recommendations, including:

- **Key Turnover Drivers**: Identify factors like job role, department, and satisfaction levels that significantly impact turnover.
- **Retention Strategies**: Suggest improvements to job satisfaction, workload management, and compensation to retain valuable employees.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Recommend specific strategies for departments or roles with high turnover rates.
- **Predictive Insights**: Use the model to predict potential turnover cases, allowing HR to proactively address issues.

## Tools and Technologies

This project uses the following tools and technologies:

- **Python**: For data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model building, evaluation, and feature selection.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
